# Project5_test



Plan for what I want to add to this project:
 

Ideally, I would like to add at least one more spell/power/skill to each base class.

I.e.:
Warrior gets a new skill called Execute that does more damage the lower the monster's health is.

Rogue gets a new skill called SurpriseStrike that does double damage if target is at full health and half damage otherwise.

Priest gets a new skill called Revive that puts someone who is "dead" back to half health and in the fight.

Mage gets a new skill called SheerCold that has rolls some rng, and has a low chance to OHKO an enemy.
